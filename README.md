# Mars Rover

## This Project is : *In Progress*

**A project I got from the Postwork section Codeup's Curriculum.**

*A pair of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars. This plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the rovers so that their on-board cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.*

*A rover's position and direction is represented by a combination of x and y coordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in the bottom left corner and facing North.*

*In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are L, R and M. The letters L and R makes the rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot. The letter M means move forward one grid point and maintain the same heading.*

*Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1)*
